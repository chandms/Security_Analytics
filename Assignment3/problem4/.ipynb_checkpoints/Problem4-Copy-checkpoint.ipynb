Hopefully this makes sense, because if we find an image $ \\vec x $ that minimizes $ C $ then that means the output of the network when given $ \\vec x $ is close to our desired output, $ \\vec y_{goal} $.

In contrast to training a network, where we perform gradient descent on the weights and biases, when we create adversarial examples we hold the weights and biases constant (because we don't want to change the network!), and change the inputs to our network."
